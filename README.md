# ECE51216 Project: DPLL SAT Solver with Advanced Heursitics. 

This repository contains an implementation of a Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solver written in Python. The solver supports solving CNF formulas in DIMACS format, using modern DPLL-based techniques such as:
- Unit propagation
- Clause simplification
- MOM (Maximum Occurrence in clauses of Minimum size) heuristic
- Conflict analysis and clause learning
- Non-chronological backtracking

In addition, this repo includes a sat test script that allows you to automatically test your SAT solver against a folder of .cnf files and evaluate its correctness and runtime performance.
